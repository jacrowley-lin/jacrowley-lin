description: The most prominent theory on how vowel spaces are shaped relies on dispersion effects to maximize perceptual contrast between sounds. This was laid out in 1972 by Liljencrants & Lindblom, but a thorough, real-world examination of the typological facts has never been completed. I am trying to gauge how accurate mathematical models are that typically rely on dispersion principles, when compared against real data from a diverse set of languages around the world.
