description: I am currently writing my preliminary paper, which focuses on how non-speakers of Chinese interpret the difficulty of Chinese dialects. Specifically, I am interested in determing if there are intrinsic acoustic features that are indicative of naïve difficulty, or if participant's perceptions are shaped by some sort of external, perhaps sociolinguistic factors.
